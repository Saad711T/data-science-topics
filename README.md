# Data science methodology
**Methodology** : A system of methods , And guidelines for decisions-making during scientific process.

## Stages of data life cycle
1. Plan : Decide what kind of data is needed.
2. Capture : Collect or bring in data from a variety of sources.
3. Manage : Care and maintain the data.
4. Analyze : Use the data to solve problems , and make decisions.
5. Archive : Keep relevant data stored from long-term and future.
6. Destroy : Remove data from storage and delete any shared copies of the data.

## Useful subjects to find more
- Machine Learning : Make computers to learn from data and make decisions . ML is field of study the AI (Artifical Intelligence) , The main method in ML is "Neural networks a nodes related with each other".
